              Isoelectric precipitation of milk protein involves lowering the pH
              to the isoelectric point of milk protein (casein) i.e around pH
              4.6. At this pH, protein's net electrical charge becomes zero
              causing electrostatic repulsion to cease and leading to minimal
              solubility, that results precipitation of milk protein.

            <p>
              Bovine milk contains four types of caseins denoted as αs1- casein,
              αs2-casein, β-casein, and κ-casein, each of which is the product
              of specific genes. The caseins, which are synthesized in the
              mammary gland, are proteins containing ester-bound phosphate and
              due to their relatively high content of proline, they tend to have
              very little secondary structure. Proteins are less soluble at
              their isoelectric point where they have zero net charge and can
              most easily approach each other with minimal charge repulsion.
              Since proteins are also less soluble at very low ionic strength,
              isoelectric precipitation is usually done at very low or no salt.
              Isoelectric precipitation is a simple and cost effective method
              that exploits the reduced solubility of proteins at their pI. By
              adjusting the solution pH to the target protein's pI, the protein
              becomes electrically neutral, leading to aggregation and
              precipitation. The precipitate is then isolated via centrifugation
              or filtration. This method is effective for bulk protein
              purification, such as in dairy processing (e.g., casein
              isolation), and is scalable for industrial applications. However,
              it has poor specificity for proteins with overlapping pI values
              and may co-precipitate impurities, necessitating additional
              purification steps. Despite these limitations, isoelectric
              precipitation remains a popular choice for largescale protein
              recovery in food science and biotechnology.

            Procedure <span class="arrow"><i class='bxr  bx-caret-right'  ></i> </span>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <ol>
              <li>
                The starting material for the production of casein is skimmed
                milk. The use of skim milk ensures that the fat content of the
                casein is low enough to minimize flavor defects arising from
                deterioration of lipids in the dried casein products.
              </li>
              <li>
                Following destabilization, the insoluble casein is separated
                from the soluble whey proteins, lactose, and salts, washed to
                remove residual soluble solids, and then dried.
              </li>
              <li>
                Casein can be produced in a number of ways, however industrially
                they are produced either by isoelectric precipitation or
                proteolytic coagulation.
              </li>
              <li>
                During isoelectric precipitation, the pH of the skim milk is
                reduced to the isoelectric point of casein.
              </li>
              <li>
                The pH decrease can be achieved by addition of a culture of
                lactic acid bacteria (converting some of the lactose of the milk
                to lactic acid), or by addition of a dilute mineral (HCl) or
                organic acid (acetic acid). The pH of skim milk can also be
                reduced to the isoelectric point of casein by mixing all or part
                of the milk with an ion-exchange resin at low temperature.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the manufacture of acid casein, precipitation is accomplished
                by under-pressure spraying dilute mineral acids (usually HCl)
                into preheated milk (25-30°C) flowing in the opposite direction
                until a pH of 4.6 is reached. Subsequently, steam is injected to
                heat the acidified milk to the precipitation temperature of
                about 50°C.
              </li>
              <li>
                As the pH of milk is falling towards the isoelectric point of
                casein, a casein gel network (the coagulum) is formed, with good
                waterholding capacity. The coagulum is then pumped from the
                coagulation vats and cooked by direct steam injection.
              </li>
            </ol>

              <b>In a Laboratory setting, </b>you can follow protocol as given
              below;
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Measure 100.0 ml of skim milk and add into a beaker. If you are
                not using skim milk, centrifuge the milk using centrifuge tubes
                to remove the fat. Centrifuge the milk at 4000 rpm at room
                temperature (25-30 °C) for 20 minutes. When centrifuging
                non-skim milk, the fat collects on top and should be removed
                before heating the milk in the next step.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transfer milk from all the tubes into the beaker and add equal
                volume of distilled water and stir well. Now check the pH ( milk
                pH= 6.7). Bring the temperature of the solution to 40°C.
              </li>
              <li>
                Start adding 0.2N HCl drop by drop into the milk. Keep stirring
                and monitor the pH using a pH electrode. The milk should start
                to curdle. If necessary, add more acid drop by drop until the pH
                reaches 4.6, which is the isoelectric point of casein. (You can
                also use 5% acetic acid instead of 0.2N HCl).
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove the mixture from the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes.

              <li>
                Rinse the precipitate with cold distilled water to remove any
                remaining acid.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transfer the casein to a pre-weighed filter paper and let it air
                dry overnight.
